Hello, world! This post serves as the introduction to my blog.

## Introduction
For those who don't know me, my name is **Lucas Doell**. I'm a software engineer, a salesman, a musician, and much more. This blog will serve as a place for me to put my thoughts on my interests, my hobbies, my profession, and my personal journey throughout the year as I focus on personal development and achieving the goals I've set for myself.

I'll be putting categories on my posts so that you can skip posts that you aren't interested in. This post will be a personal post, programming posts will be tagged with 'Technology', etc. Categorization should allow you to filter through the posts you don't care about.

Throughout 2024, there's some things I'd like to achieve: 

### Work on my personal health and get in better shape
With a lot of my time being spent on the computer, I've put my health to the wayside while I've focused on building software. I want to change this and spend more time focusing on being physically active, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep. I plan on documenting my fitness journey and will be sharing my thoughts here.

### Get better at writing software
One of the things I've been focusing a lot on within the past few months is my app [Parsertime](https://parsertime.app). I want to write other cool apps for my own personal use, work on cool features for the apps I'm maintaining, and explore new languages and technology to continue learning new paradigms. One area I'd like to explore is iOS app developmentâ€”I recently purchased a Mac Studio and plan on using it to make an app that I can use to help my personal development journey.

### Improve with person skills and become a better salesman
I want to continue throughout sales and focus on building great customer relationships while maintaining ethics and morality. Sales has a bad reputation for being a sleazy, scummy business, but I want to focus on achieving sales goals without sacrificing integrity. Building trust and genuine customer relationships will help me exceed my targets while not compromising on my personal morals.

### Do a better job of maintaining my personal relationships
Something I can improve upon is maintaining my close relationships with friends and family. I can zero in on the project or goal that I'm working on and I spend less time talking to my friends and family as a result. I want to ensure that I can work hard while still making time for the people closest to me.

### ...and so much more
I have a lot of goals and targets I want to reach for. It would take a long time to list them all, but my main focus is to become the best possible version of myself that I can be. Feel free to follow my journey here as I focus on building a better "me" and becoming the person I want to be.

Cheers to self-improvement! ðŸŽ‰
